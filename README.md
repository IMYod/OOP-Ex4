## The changes relative to the previous exercise:

Goal of the game: Get the most points in any simulation. 
 
 1. It is possible to move only one player (called player, marked with the letter "M").
    Controlling a player is by giving direction in degrees to his movement. 
    When all traffic is within the area defined in the previous exercise, and all traffic is in 2D only. (The height dimension is always 0).
 
 2. There are also obstacles (black rectangles), the player can not pass through them, 
    in fact any entry to a black rectangle or exit outside the boundaries of the field drops a point. 
    The black rectangles are marked with a letter B.
 
 3. Beyond the player there are also other pacmans (marked with the letter P) who want to eat the fruit. It
    is possible to eat this time both the fruit and the pecmans, get for each eating of the fruit or the paceman usually point.  
 
 4. In addition, there are ghosts that chasing player M, which are marked with a letter G. The player is set to be faster than them. 
    The ghosts are defined as being able to cross the obstacles as opposed to the player. For each ghosts arrival, the player drops 20 points. 
    And then there are three seconds of grace to continue to escape.
